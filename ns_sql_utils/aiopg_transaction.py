class transaction:
    """A context manager to collect nested calls in a transaction

    To use, anywhere you want to have queries put into a transaction, do

        async with transaction(aiopg_engine) as trx:
            ...

    The resulting trx object can be used just like a connection you would
    get from `aiopg_engine.acquire()`, but any nested usages of this decorator
    will ensure that we do not deadlock from nested acquire calls, and do not
    run into errors where we attempt to use the same connection to make
    multiple calls at once.
    NB: It does this by ensuring that we get the same connection object and
    execute serially, so you only want to use this in cases where you are
    worried about these issues.

    For example, using just aiopg, this is an error:

        async with engine.acquire() as conn:
            await asyncio.gather(
                conn.execute(TABLE.insert().values(id=uuid(), name="foo")),
                conn.execute(TABLE.insert().values(id=uuid(), name="bar")))

    But using this class, we will not error:

        async with transaction(engine) as conn:
            await asyncio.gather(
                conn.execute(TABLE.insert().values(id=uuid(), name="foo")),
                conn.execute(TABLE.insert().values(id=uuid(), name="bar")))

    Note:
        There are limits to the transaction rollback protection that this
        context manager affords. Specifically, a known failure case can be
        encountered if a DB connection is created by calling `Engine.acquire`
        rather than `transaction(Engine)`, even if the call to `acquire` is
        made within a transaction context. For more information, see:
        :py:module:`python_core.tests.functional
        .test_aiopg_transaction_integrity`.
